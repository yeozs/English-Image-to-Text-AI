Quick Fix to Converting Images to Text Document

Reason for Creation: Wanted a fast method to convert pdf and whatsapp/telegram screenshots into text. It was possible to google it but what a better way than to code out the quick fix!

Managed to find some help from Replit Community to use pytesseract. https://replit.com/talk/ask/Pytesseract-Auto-Shell-Install-Package-Issue/140049
Problem was the code didn't write the converted text into a docx file. 
My code helps to alleviate that problem.


How to Use:
1. Download all the documents.
2. Install the necessary python packages (PIL and pytesseract)
